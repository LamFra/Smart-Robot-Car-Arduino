# Smart Robot Car with Arduino 

Basically, this project is based on the construction of an intelligent car through the combination of the various components that enable basic operations that make it possible: going forward or backward with the car and turning left or right. This can all be managed through communication with the Bluetooth module to a device connected with an app for Android. 

## Getting Started

Basically it's possible to download files with the *.ino extension and try them within the IDE. 

### Prerequisites
 
- Smart Robot Car kit
- Arduino Uno or other compatible with Arduino Uno
- Bluetooth Module HC05
- Motor Driver Controller L298N
