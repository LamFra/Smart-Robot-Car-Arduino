# Smart Robot Car with Arduino 

Basically, this project is based on the construction of an intelligent car through the combination of the various components that enable basic operations that make it possible: going forward or backward with the car and turning left or right. This can all be managed through communication with the Bluetooth module to a device connected with an app for Android. 

## Getting Started

Basically it's possible to download files with the *.ino extension and try them within the IDE. 

### Prerequisites
 
- Robot Car kit
- Arduino Uno or other compatible with Arduino Uno
- Bluetooth Module HC05
- Motor Driver Controller L298N

## Built With

  - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
  - [Bluetooth Controller App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giumig.apps.bluetoothserialmonitor)
  
## Future Developments

- driving smart car movements through the use of an infrared sensor sensitive to black lines on a homogeneous background;
- including a proximity sensor that will enable the smart car to recognize obstacles;
- incorporating the MQTT protocol or the use of node red
